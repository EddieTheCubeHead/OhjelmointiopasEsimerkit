# OhjelmointiopasEsimerkit

These are all the code examples I am using in my Bachelor's thesis' technical task (programming guide for OOP basics).

Tests are only written as an excercise to myself and will not be visible to the users of the guide.

The guide itself can be found here (in Finnish): https://github.com/EddieTheCubeHead/LUT-ohjelmoinnin-perusteet-ohjelmointiopas
